# Project Scope
AI-Powered Smart Classroom Scheduling System

## Objective
To design and develop a system that automatically generates
conflict-free classroom timetables using constraint-based optimization.

## Target Users
- System Administrator (primary user)
- Faculty (view-only access)
- Students (view-only access)

## In Scope
- Classroom timetable generation for academic courses
- Constraint-based scheduling (no conflicts)
- Room capacity validation
- Faculty availability constraints
- Admin dashboard for data management
- Timetable visualization

## Out of Scope
- Attendance tracking
- Student performance analytics
- Learning Management System (LMS) integration
- Real-time IoT classroom monitoring
- Manual timetable editing

## Assumptions
- All required data is provided before schedule generation
- Timetable generation is done per semester
- Users interact through a web interface

## Success Criteria
- Generated timetables have no time, room, or faculty conflicts
- Scheduling respects all defined constraints
- System produces results within acceptable time limits
